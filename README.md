# Glutathione-Metabolism-Modeling
This project focuses on modeling glutathione (GSH) metabolism using ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The goal is to simulate how GSH levels change under oxidative stress and compare model predictions to experimental data.

Simulations were done using COPASI, Mathematica, and MATLAB, and curve fitting was performed to match experimental GSH labeling data collected from mass spectrometry imaging (fMSI).

This project was completed as part of the Abrams Scholar Program at the NC State and UNC Lampe Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering.
